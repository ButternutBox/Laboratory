# Laboratory ðŸ§ª

Laboratory is an A/B testing and Feature Flag framework for Rails. It's focused on a number of key philosophies, all garnered from running A/B tests and feature flags in commercial settings and experiencing issues with other A/B testing gems out there:

* Cohesiveness
  * A/B tests and feature flags are, in many ways, very similar. Laboratory looks to marry them into a single 'Experiment' concept.
* Flexiblity
  * Laboratory allows you manage your A/B tests and feature flags with no code changes, through the Laboratory UI.
* Tracability and Accountability
  * It is vital that any updates or changes to an A/B test or feature flag is documented in a changelog with full tracability back to the user who performed the change. This is built into Laboratory.
* Simplicity, while not being simplisitic
  * Laboratory comes with a single A/B test algorithm and single storage adapter built-in, which we think will cover 99% of use cases for A/B testing and Feature Flagging. If you're in that 1%, it's easy to extend Laboratory to add custom Algorithms and Storage mechanisms.

Laboratory builds upon great work from other gems, in particular [Split](https://github.com/splitrb/split).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'laboratory', require: 'laboratory/ui'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install laboratory


## Usage

### Defining the adapter

In an initializer (`app/config/initializers/laboratory.rb`), define the adapter you are going to use with Laboratory. Laboratory supports Redis out of the box, as it the recommended adapter:

```ruby
Laboratory.config.adapter = Laboratory::Adapters::RedisAdapter.new(url: 'redis://localhost:6789') # Adjust to your redis URL.
```

### Defining your current_user_id & actor

Laboratory needs to know which user is currently active when determining which variant to use for an experiment. It is also useful to define an 'actor' - the user who actions any changes to any Laboratory experiments - for better accountability and tracability tracking through the changelog.

For **Rails**, we recommend defining a before_action in application_controller to do this:

```ruby
class ApplicationController

  before_action :set_laboratory_current_user_id
  before_action :set_laboratory_actor

  def set_laboratory_current_user_id
    Laboratory.config.current_user_id = your_current_user_id
  end

  def set_laboratory_actor
    Laboratory.config.actor = 'Tom Jones'
  end
```

Note: From experience, we recommend storing an identifier in a cookie once a new device is identified, and storing it on the user once that user has been identified (by signing up, logging in etc). This identifier should not change when the user logs out as otherwise you will find users experiencing multiple variants of the same test.


### Setting up an experiment

We recommend defining all of your A/B tests and feature flags in a single location (like an initializer) to make it easy to keep track of all tests and flags running but it absolutely possible to define them wherever they are needed. We use `find_or_create` below to create them to ensure they are created the first time they are deployed, and maintained throughout:

```ruby
Laboratory::Experiment.find_or_create(
  id: 'blue_button_ab_test',
  variants: [
    {
      id: 'control',
      percentage: 50 # Note these percentages are just the initial starting percentages and may be adjusted dynamically in the future.
    },
    {
      id: 'variant_a',
      percentage: 50
    }
  ]
)

Laboratory::Experiment.find_or_create(
  id: 'new_checkout_feature_flag',
  variants: [
    {
      id: 'control',
      percentage: 100
    },
    {
      id: 'new_checkout',
      percentage: 0
    }
  ]
)
```

### Using an experiment

Once an experiment has been defined, it's simple to use the experiment:

```ruby
experiment = Laboratory::Experiment.find('blue_button_ab_test')
variant = experiment.variant

if variant.id == 'control'
  ...
else
  ...
end
```

Note the `#variant` method also takes an optional user parameter should you want to define the user specifically in this case. It defaults to a user with the current_user_id defined in the Laboratory configuration.

### Defining an event

Events are a way to track key milestones for the purposes of later analysis. Each event is then displayed on the Laboratory Dashboard with significance levels. An event can be recorded as follows:

```ruby
experiment = Laboratory::Experiment.find('blue_button_ab_test')
experiment.record_event!('completed')
```

Note the `#record_event!` method also takes an optional user parameter should you want to define the user specifically in this case. It defaults to a user with the current_user_id defined in the Laboratory configuration.

### Using the Laboratory UI

It's easy to analyse and manage your experiment from the dashboard. In routes.rb, mount the dashboard behind your appropriate authentication layer (this example uses Devise):

```ruby
authenticate :admin_user do
  mount Laboratory::UI, at: 'admin/laboratory'
  ...
end
```

You can now visit /admin/laboratory to view the progess of your experiment, and update the variants as needed.

### Analytics Integrations

It's common to trigger analytics events upon common actions like a user being assigned to a variant, or an event occuring. Laboratory makes it easy to do this through two callback handlers that can be defined as so:

**When a user gets assigned to a variant**:

```ruby
Laboratory.config.on_assignment_to_variant = -> (experiment, variant, user) {
  ...
}
```

**When an event is recorded**:

```ruby
Laboratory.config.on_event_recorded = -> (experiment, variant, user, event) {
  ...
}
```

### Managing an Experiment outside the regular request cycle

Sometimes, you need to go a bit deeper with a test to understand which users are seeing which variant, or enforce a certain variant for a user. Laboratory has a number of tools to help you do this.

**Finding all participants in a variant**:

```ruby
experiment = Laboratory::Experiment.find('blue_button_cta')
control = experiment.variants.first

control.participants_id
```

**Setting a user to a specific variant**:

```ruby
experiment = Laboratory::Experiment.find('blue_button_cta')
user = Laboratory::User.new(id: 1)

experiment.assign_to_variant('control', user: user)
```

Note the `#assign_to_variant` method also takes an optional user parameter should you want to define the user specifically in this case (like above). It defaults to a user with the current_user_id defined in the Laboratory configuration if you omit it.

**Fetching the changelog for an experiment**

```ruby
experiment = Laboratory::Experiment.find('blue_button_cta')
experiment.changelog
```

**Finding all the experiments a user is in**:

```ruby
user = Laboratory::User.new(id: 1)
user.experiments
```

**Finding the variant a user is in for a specific experiment**:

```ruby
experiment = Laboratory::Experiment.find('blue_button_cta')
user = Laboratory::User.new(id: 1)

user.variant_for_experiment(experiment) # Note: This returns nil if the user is not in the experiment
```

**Updating an experiment's variants**:

Note: This would wipe all users from the experiment.

```ruby
experiment = Laboratory::Experiment.find('blue_button_cta')
control = experiment.variants.find { |variant| variant.id == 'control' }
variant_a = experiment.variants.find { |variant| variant.id == 'variant_a' }

control.percentage = 30
variant_a.percentage = 70

experiment.save
```

**Finding the current user**:

The following will return a Laboratory::User object with the user id matching the current_user_id defined in the Laboratory configuration.

```ruby
Laboratory.config.current_user
```


### Building your own adapters and algorithms

**Adapters**:

Any adapter just needs to the respond to the following methods:

* `#write(experiment)`
* `#read(experiment_id)`
* `#read_all`
* `#delete(experiment_id)`
* `#delete_all`

**Algorithm**:

Any algorithm just needs to respond to a `#pick!(variants)` and a `#id` method, and needs to be added to the `Laboratory::Algorithms#ALGORITHMS` definition. The `#id` method returns an identifier that is used for serialisation purposes.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
